This repository contains the datasets and code needed to reproduce experiments from our project "Meta-learning for time series forecasting in application to ATM load time series".

# Project goal

The goal of the project was to use the meta-learning algorithm to predict the best suited model to predict time series. Picking a suitable model is time consuming and computationally expensive - especially with many choices of models and large number of time series to predict. So, our approach can save plenty of time.
